To Do (Organizing, feel free to add what you want or don't, I probably won't touch it if it's not here)
- Netcode: idk where or what to put anywhere but it needs to be there for multiplayer.
- Decompile source: gotta get them AI styles to avoid making a lot of the aformentioned netcode.
- Flamethrower sprites: eh, the most important is the dungeon, jungle, and hellstone flamethrowers since they thematically are different from say, a crimson or frost flamethrower.
- Learn to make tiles: Shadow anvil?
- NPCS: Probably going to copy the code from the eye of cthulu and make it amongus, probably could do the same for the rat with a bunny
- Balancing: So far the Cobalt Greatsword is the only balanced item. Will work on others once crafting becomes more real.
- Crafting: For the early game flamethrowers, could probably use base game materials, but gonna need to add a broken hero flamethrower XD
- Mob Drops: Broken hero flamethrower, Shadow Flames; Possibly from the goblins but also probably make new goblins that spawn underground or somtin, Orange slice and Grapefruit slice?
- Armor: I got no plans but if you are reading this, go for it.
- Accessories: ^
- Eye of Rot: Netcode may be there as the projectile was pulled from example mod, also gotta remove the projectile rotate perhaps
- Lunar Longbow: Scrapping the idea of it doing more damage when aimed down, giving it an alt fire mode that forces you to aim down for extra damage; As a sidenote, maybe add more damage at night for the memes?
- Moonshot/Moonrifle: Give it a projectile and an animation for the memes if bored.
- Chatterball: Kyle gives sprite, I make chatterball.
- True Lightthrower: Lightthrower + Broken Hero Flamethrower
- True Darkthrower: Darkthrower + Broken Hero Flamethrower
- Terrathrower/Allthrower: True Lightthrower + True Darkthrower + Flamethrower for the memes
- True Allthrower: Moon Lord Drop, perhaps a moon lord themed flame that definitely isn't completely broken.
- Darkthrower/Night's Flare: Combine the flames of the Jungle, Dungeon, Corruption, Crimson, and Hellfire flamethrowers to create this.
- Projectile Sword Test: Arkhalis but it's cooler.
- Loaf: Make them worth it. Even for the memes.
